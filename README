1. miniDAQ raw data needs CMSSW_7_2_1
2. global run raw data needs CMSSW_7_3_2_patch4

To analyze splash events:

test/splash/test.py can be used for minidaq data.

run xFitShapeAll in test/splash/ana to extract timing
https://github.com/cmkuo/MyAnalyzer/tree/master/ESAnalyzer/test/splash/ana
draw the event display using xEventDisplay.C

To analyze data integrity:

the analyzer is ESAnalyzer/src/ESDIAnalyzer.cc
the py file is ESAnalyzer/test/check_DataIntegrity.py 

To analyze cosmic or collision data:

the analyzer is ESAnalyzer/src/CollisionAnalyzer.cc 
the py file is ESAnalyzer/test/commissioning_2015.py for FEVT data and ESAnalyzer/test/commissioning_raw_2015.py for raw data



>> To launch jobs on lxbatch:
work forder is MyAnalyzer/ESAnalyzer/test/Run_lxbatch_jobs
     update in/out path and decide files splitting in params_lxbatch.CFG
     prepare list of .root files as in runList_LSF.txt
     prepare jobs with "perl launchJobs_lxbatch_LSF.pl params_lxbatch.CFG"
     launch jobs with "source launch.sh"
